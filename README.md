# mendeley-web
I really like mendeley desktop but honestly, we can do better. I'll try to create a web client for mendeley. The main focus is on annotations. This will probably be done by combining [pdf.js](http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) and [annotator.js](http://annotatorjs.org/). A example of pdfjs + annotatorjs can already be found here: https://github.com/hypothesis/pdf.js-hypothes.is.

## future
Since this is a future project and I like to learn new things every time I so something I have decided to use "future" tools. Lets call it ES6. On the server I will use [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and cliente (not sure yet) [aurelia](http://aurelia.io/).
